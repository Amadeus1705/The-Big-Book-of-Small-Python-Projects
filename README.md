# The Big Book of Small Python Projects

This repository contains my implementations of the projects from the book [*The Big Book of Small Python Projects*](https://nostarch.com/big-book-small-python-projects) by Al Sweigart. Each project is designed to be short, simple, and educational, perfect for beginners looking to learn Python through hands-on practice.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to practice Python programming by implementing a variety of small projects. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different aspects of Python programming, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts. The projects are sourced from *The Big Book of Small Python Projects*, which is an excellent resource for beginners.

## Project List

Below is a list of projects implemented so far:

1. [Bagels](https://github.com/Amadeus1705/The-Big-Book-of-Small-Python-Projects/blob/main/Chapter1.py) - A deductive logic game where you must guess a number based on clues.  

*More projects will be added as they are completed.*

## How to Run

To run any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/big-book-python-projects.git
   cd big-book-python-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd projects
   ```

3. **Run the desired project**:
   ```sh
   python bagels.py
   ```

Each project is designed to be run independently. Follow the instructions provided in the console for each project to interact with it.

## Contributing
